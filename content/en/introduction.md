The book of Proverbs says that "he who states his case first seems right until another comes and challenges him." That is certainly true regarding the theory of evolution. This book, _The Evolution Handbook_, is a must-read, because it presents scientific evidence that challenges the theory of evolution. The destructive nature of evolutionary theory has permeated most of our social sciences, undermined objective truth, and fostered nihilism. This book is a great tool for parents, teachers, and students who want to understand the truth about the origins of life. Everyone who is concerned about our future ought to read this book.

_The Evolution Handbook_ can easily replace as many as forty books on the subject. It is the final and definitive statement on everything that could be found in any library that deals with evolutionary theory, as it relates to astrophysics, biology, speciation, calendation, paleontology, or geochronology. The greatest thing about this book is its complete coverage. It can save you a lot of money in obtaining comprehensive data on evolutionary theory, and how to reply to it. The definitive work on the subject, it answers every basic theory; yet it is remarkably easy to read.
