> "The evolutionary establishment fears creation science because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionist scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate."

> "It was because Darwinian theory broke man’s link with God and set him adrift in a cosmos without purpose or end that its impact was so fundamental. No other intellectual revolution in modern times . . so profoundly affected the way men viewed themselves and their place in the universe."

> "Unfortunately, in the field of evolution most explanations are not good. As a matter of fact, they hardly qualify as explanations at all; they are suggestions, hunches, pipe dreams, hardly worthy of being called hypotheses."

> "As by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed. Why do we not find them embedded in the crust of the earth? Why is not all nature in confusion instead of being, as we see them, well-defined species?"

## The origin of this book and how to use it

This paperback is based on our 1,326-page, three-volume Evolution Disproved Series. Not included in this paperback are several thousand statements by scientists. You will find them (plus links to major Creationist organizations) on our website: evolution-facts.org. We frequently update the collection with additional ones.

**The complete three-volume set is now out of print but can viewed free of charge on our website: evolution-facts.org**

**The 3-volume set (which you can find on our website) includes about 4,000 quotations. More are added to the website from time to time. It also contains many more illustrations (50 diagrams, 27 charts, 10 reproductions, 74 sketches or drawings, 8 maps, 5 pictures, and 222 pen-point pictures). Only 43 pages of those illustrations are in this paperback.**

**Copy whatever you want from our website, at no charge, and share it widely. There is a real need for this information to be widely circulated. However, this present paperback will be your best tool for the widest education of others, whether students, church members, or the general public. This low-cost book can be used to directly reach people, as few other books can.**

### Symbols

The following symbols are used in this book:

\* An **asterisk** before a name indicates that the person named and/or quoted is not known to be a Creationist.

<u>Underlining</u> generally indicates <u>a special evidence disproving evolution</u>. This helps you more quickly grasp the key points.

_**(\*#1/19 Scientists Oppose the Explosion Theory\*)** Example:_ This reference is found in our chapter on the Big Bang. Go to the same chapter title on our website. Then go to its Appendix 1. You will there find 19 more quotations, plus other data.

**This book provides you with common sense facts which you can use in study, conversation, and research. It is available, in small cases, at an extremely low cost. In fact, the boxful price is so low (only a dollar a copy, plus postage), you can easily purchase boxes of them and give or sell it to others who need it.**

With an easy-to-read print size, you will want to keep this paperback for years to come—for general reading and to check on a controverted point. If you plan to take a science course in school, or go into any field related to science or technology, you will want to read this book several times. Many of the points will remain in your memory, so you can share them with others. **The scientific facts presented here will help insulate you from the desolating effects of evolutionary theory.**

**This book is very interesting reading! Yet it is also an excellent reference manual. By using the table of contents and index, you can quickly find what you are looking for—just when you need it. By looking in the Index for a key word, you will find still more information on a given topic.**

### Additional copies

Additional copies may be purchased from your bookseller. This paperback is also available at the very lowest cost in small boxful amounts from us, so you can share them with your friends. Others need this information as much as you do! The schools are leading people into atheism! Our address is on the bottom of page 2.

Although the cover price of this book is quite low, **—the price of a small boxful of these books is terrifically low, whether you want to give books away or sell them at a profit. It is urgent that the truth about Creation and evolution be shared as widely as possible!**

### Quotations in this book

**There are 1,352 quotations in this book, nearly all of them from evolutionist scientists.** Those statements provide you with solid scientific facts from experts. Dates of quotation sources vary from Charles Darwin’s time, down to 2006.

### Quotations sources

Quotation references are always given immediately in the text, not off somewhere at the back of the book. You do not have to repeatedly flip pages to find references. (\* before a name = he is not a Creationist.)

### Understandable content

A primary objective of the book is to keep everything simple and easily understood. No complex mathematics are included.

### Measurement equivalents

Each measurement (whether given in English or metric) is immediately followed within brackets by its equivalent. This is a feature rarely found even in scientific publications. That makes this book useful all over the world.

### Variation in chapter content

Because of its content, the second chapter of this book (_The Big Bang and Stellar Evolution_) lent itself to a somewhat different layout style than the other chapters. **That chapter condenses 116 large pages and is in a point-by-point summary arrangement. The remainder of the book is in a looser style.**

### Translation permission

**You are hereby given permission to translate any part of this book into any foreign language for sale or free distribution.** We would ask, however, that you try to keep the sale price low. There is an urgent need for people—especially young people—to learn what is in this book.

### Background of this book

In the summer of 1989, the author learned that the California State Department of Education had recently notified the private, non-tax funded Graduate School of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), that it would have to close its doors if it did not begin teaching evolutionary origins and processes in its science classes.

Since 1972, ICR has worked steadily to educate the public in regard to the many evidences disproving evolution. An attempt to close their college because it would not teach that which its doctoral scientists knew to be error—and had satisfactorily shown to be error—was ridiculous; yet this is the situation our nation is coming to.

That education department ruling crystallized in the author the conviction that an in-depth book needed to be written to help awaken the thinking public to what scientific facts really have to say about Creation science and evolutionary theory. (Incidentally, by court action, the ruling was later rescinded.)

The three-volume set, on which this present paperback is based, was the result. It brought together one of the largest, single collections of data on the subject, and is based on about 200 periodicals and an equal number of books. It is a book written for thinking people everywhere. Scientific professionals can learn a lot from it, but it was written for everyone.

### How to use this book

**This paperback, containing the best of the three-volume set, is excellent for (1) personal knowledge enrichment; (2) data when you need it on a certain science topic; (3) private school and home-school chapter reading or research topic assignments; (4) church-group study; and (5) sermon, prayer meeting, and lecture source material.** The index at the back of this book will help you quickly find what you are looking for.

**There is enough material in this present book to form the basis for a sizeable number of high-school, college, or university research papers.** Even those working on advanced theses will find the source material, provided here, extremely helpful. When conducting such research, you will want to also use the greatly expanded collection of data and statements by scientists, found on our website: evolution-facts.org.

### Study and review questions

The questions at the end of each chapter are designed for grades 5 through 12. The student can use the questions as a basis for further study. The teacher may wish to assign some of them. The simplest are generally given first, followed by more advanced ones.

### Share copies of this paperback with others

The more you study and learn, the more you can help other people. They need this information as much as you do.

### Special research guide

Appendix I of this book is _A Research Guide_. It will help students in school prepare reports based on these scientific facts.

### Scientific statements

In addition to those found all through this book, chapter 23 has an outstanding collection of them.

### Position of this book

This book agrees with a broad range of scientific evidence, that our world is only several thousand years old and that a worldwide Flood has occurred. See chapter 4, _Age of the Earth_, for more on this.

### Nature nuggets

The "design factor" is an overwhelming evidence of Creation. You will find examples of natural wonders, _which evolution could not possibly produce_, at the end of most chapters in this book. The location of all 28 is listed on the top of page 980. (Turn to page 316 for a sample.)
